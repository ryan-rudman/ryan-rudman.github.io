It takes inspiration from Elm's functional approach while remaining undogmatic, pragmatic and retaining the flexibility that JS offers.</p><p> I started building Karbon as a way to understand the virtual dom approach used in React and other popular frameworks. However, I realised that I could go much further than this and try to address some of the things I disliked about the component approach; creating something with more separated concerns around the view and model layers and a more logical approach to state and effects management.</p><p>The result was Karbon which is a fully functional UI framework. In fact this site is built with it.
